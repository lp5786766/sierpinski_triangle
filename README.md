# sierpinski_triangle

## Idea
As claimed in this TikTok (https://www.tiktok.com/@mathletters/video/7081424281309170986?is_copy_url=1&is_from_webapp=v1&q=math%20letters&t=1652290809303) if you put a random dot within an equilateral triangle and then continue adding dots according to the rules, you will inevitably end up with a fractal that is commonly known as the Sierpinski Triangle.

However, it is worth checking what impact could the first random dot - the only factor that is up to the user - have on the finished image.

I will build this app (so help me ODIN!) to check this theory and the impact of the first dot.

## Rules
1) Create an equilateral triangle by putting three first dots on the field. Let's call them A, B, C.
2) The user inputs one dot (anywhere within the ABC triangle).
3) the rest is done by the app. Each next dot is placed between the last placed dot and the randomly chosen vertex (A, B or C).

In order to follow the process of creation of the fractal, I will allow the user to put 10 dots at a time, 100 or 1000.
